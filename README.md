## Homework
### Technical project
Part of our interview process requires a technical conversation to understand your problem solving and development mindset, the most efficient way of doing this is to have some code already available that you are comfortable talking through and also has some technical complexity that could be discussed with other engineers. If you don't have any projects readily available to speak to and walk through, please feel free to utilize the attached project outline. This should not be time intensive, we need to be able to have a conversation, not deploy to production. (smile)

## Interviews
### Project Presentation
This is your opportunity to present your project to the team, the focus of this presentation is to gather your comfort level in talking through code and design and field questions from team members as to the implementation technique.

Please do not feel like this is rigid or structured, the goal is for you to present one of the projects you have made, in whatever format works best in that perspective (usually we see app demos in the web space), then to dive into some of the code so you can talk have a free and open chat about what you did, how you did it, and why. Allocate no more than 10 minutes for the presentation/demo, it's the coding deep dive that's the fun part.

Our team collaborates via meetings and PR's as we're a remote shop, the goal here it to get a better handle on not just your technical skills, but how you communicate your thoughts and work within the team environment.

The questions and conversation are designed to be fluid, but I'd expect some of them to fall in line with some of your favourite pieces of code, some of the challenges you've encountered, improvement opportunities, lessons learned, and things within that nature. 

We provide the ability to share your screen, you may also circulate your repo link in the chat if you feel that might be beneficial when talking through some of the tech aspects.

### Resumé Review
This interview focuses on your background, the places you’ve worked, the teams you’ve been part of, and the impact you’ve had. We’re interested in learning the story of how you arrived at where you are in your career and understanding the key experiences and opportunities that have shaped you in the process.

### Process Review
Our goal is to understand the depth and breadth of experiences you’ve had as an engineer. We’ll look to understand the types of roles you’ve led, the teams you've worked with and your experience with an Agile organization, and Product Owners/Managers.

### Closing
This interview is your time to ask any final questions you might have about Oppy and to provide feedback about your experiences during the day.

## What you should expect at interviews
A brief introduction to Oppy.

Each interview will last approximately 45 - 60 minutes and many will give you a chance to ask questions about Oppy or the role. These interviews will cover a number of technical and cultural assessments as described above.

A 30-minute chat with a Oppy engineer, this is not a part of the interview process and is not included in the evaluation. It provides you an opportunity to learn more about Oppy by asking questions about our products, engineering culture, what it’s like to work at Oppy, etc.

### During the technical review/project presentation.
We’re interested in how you approach the problem and any technology challenges, limitations, or benefits that you discovered whilst building your solution.
